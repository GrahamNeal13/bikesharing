 Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau
 
## Bikesharing Presentation:
### Using NYC as a model for future programs.

## Using Tableau to present our data.  
For this analysis, we have used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we have created a set of visualizations to:

    - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Overview:

Using the data from New York City we can see the popularity with both commuters and tourists in using bicycles.  The idea that one of the largest cities on the east coast can provide a great oppurtunity for other cities.  Based on the most common times the bikes are used we can also see when it would be the best time to collect bikes for repair.
