# BikeSharing
 Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau
 
## Bikesharing Presentation:
### Using NYC as a model for future programs.

## Using Tableau to present our data.  
For this analysis, we have used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we have created a set of visualizations to:

    - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Overview:

Using the data from New York City we can see the popularity with both commuters and tourists in using bicycles.  The idea that one of the largest cities on the east coast can provide a great oppurtunity for other cities.  Based on the most common times the bikes are used we can also see when it would be the best time to collect bikes for repair.

Also the data shows us that the gender that will be using the bikes most often is actaully males.  This may be due to the fact that men typically wear clothes that are aligned with riding a bike.

We can also see that the among the customers it is the commuters who are the subscribers that will be the main users of the bikes.

## Summary:

Overall we can see that a program like Citibike is a great oppurtunity for advertising businesses on the bikes themselves.  And a great method of travel for local commuters and tourists alike.  This is a great investment oppurtunity as well as a public relations celebration, by letting hundreds of people use bicycles we are also helping the environment.  Other charts we can make from this data would be to see how many people are choosing to use the bike sharing program instead of public transportation and personal transportation.  With the station names we could also see which stations are the most popular and send our maintenance teams there to rotate out bikes to prevent early wear and tear.
